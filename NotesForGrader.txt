This program is written in C++ in Windows Power Shell on Tesla server.
The main program is main.cpp and the command to run the program is g++ main.cpp -o main anf enter ./main.
The program uses randomly generated data, but does not use srand(time(NULL)) as the consistency of the 
input data is required to plot the graph. By using srand(time(NULL)), the program will generate different 
random input number and the results of the swaps and comparisons will be different every time the program
is run and it will be difficult for the grader to check the input data from the program and from the excel sheet.
